# Another DnD

AnotherDnD is antoher DnD website (ah!) that manages spells, characters, monsters, feats -- you name it!

Since the website is in its early stages, we just want to get something up on the screen. If you're curious though, the roadmap is below all the configuration stuff.

Speaking of configuration stuff....


## Install

First, install `yarn` with `homebrew`:

```
brew install yarn
```

Then, install local dependencies for the project:

```
yarn install
```

That's it!

<hr>

To run the local server (Sass/Vue compiling, etc.), do the following:

```
yarn dev
```

We're using yarn instead of npm for... reasons. The good thing is that in 99% tutorials, whenever you see an `npm` command, just replace `npm` with `yarn` and remove any `i` or `--save` directives. Voil√†, yarn!
